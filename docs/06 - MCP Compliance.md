Minions adheres to the [Model Connector Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/spec/mcp.md):

- Agent Recipes define system prompts and goals
- Step Graphs enable structured orchestration
- Memory strategies respect MCPâ€™s memory boundaries
- Tool calls are structured and interoperable

This makes Minions compatible with emerging standards in agent orchestration and allows potential future interop with platforms like LangGraph.
